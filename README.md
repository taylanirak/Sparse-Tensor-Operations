# Sparse-Tensor-Operations
Description

This project is a C++ program designed to work with sparse tensors. It reads sparse tensor data from input files, processes them, and performs operations based on the requirements of the program logic. The program is efficient in handling sparse data structures using linked lists.

Features

Implements a sparse tensor using linked lists for efficient memory usage.

Processes non-zero tensor elements read from input files.

Supports operations to identify specific patterns or conditions within the sparse tensor.

Outputs the results of the processed sparse tensor data.
